# Notes
**This is provided for reference only - I don't plan on maintaining this**

This is heavily based on https://code.google.com/p/cpp-project-template/. I just made a few minor modifications for my own use case.

# Pre-requisites
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.8+
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
  * Boost C++ Libraries v1.49+ [HEADERS and LIBRARIES]
